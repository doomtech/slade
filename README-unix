SLADE3 SVN UNIX COMPILATION INSTRUCTIONS
----------------------------------------
1)
Download the required libraries (most should be available in your distro's package repository):
-wxWidgets *2.9+* from http://wxwidgets.org (most repositories don't currently have 2.9)
-FreeImage from http://freeimage.sourceforge.net
-FluidSynth from http://fluidsynth.org
-Audiere from http://audiere.sourceforge.net

2)
Compile/install the required libraries if needed.

a) wxWidgets:
-Extract the wxWidgets tar
-Follow the instructions in docs/gtk/install.txt ('the simplest case'), but add '--with-opengl' to the ../configure line

b) FreeImage:
-Extract the FreeImage tar
-Follow the instructions in README.linux (to install normal FreeImage, not FreeImagePlus)

3)
To compile SLADE3, there are two ways to go about it, either install CodeLite IDE and use that (recommended),
or build it using the Makefile

a) IDE Compilation
-Download and install CodeLite IDE from http://codelite.org
-Run CodeLite
-Select Workspace->Switch to workspace... and select 'SLADE.workspace' in the trunk directory of the SLADE SVN
-Select Release configuration from the drop-down box on the workspace view if it isn't already selected
-Click the 'Build Active Project' button on the toolbar

b) Makefile Compilation
-Just type 'make' to compile the release build, or 'make -f Makefile-debug' to compile the debug build

And that should be it. If you are having problems I can be contacted via email:

OTHER SLADE3 UNIX ISSUES
------------------------
Audio support:
The current release of Audiere is quite old, and can cause some problems. For one, it only supports OSS output
in linux. If your distro has dropped OSS support (eg ubuntu 10.10), you'll have to get the alsa-oss wrapper,
and run slade3 like "aoss ./slade3", or no audio playback (except MIDI via fluidsynth) will be available.
If you cannot get Audiere packages for your distro (and don't try compiling it - it won't), it is possible to
disable it (and therefore all sound playback) by using Makefile-no_audiere in trunk. The CodeLite project currently
has Audiere disabled in unix.

Ubuntu 11.04:
wxWidgets 2.9.1 has some issues with Ubuntu 11.04. These are fixed in wxWidgets 2.9.2 on the wx SVN. Instructions
for checking out the wxWidgets svn can be found here: <http://www.wxwidgets.org/develop/svn.htm>. The compilation
instructions for 2.9.1 above also apply for 2.9.2.
