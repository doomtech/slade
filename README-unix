SLADE3 SVN UNIX COMPILATION INSTRUCTIONS
----------------------------------------
1)
Download the required libraries:
-wxWidgets *2.9+* from http://wxwidgets.org (or use synaptic/apt-get on debian/ubuntu)
-FreeImage from http://freeimage.sourceforge.net (or use synaptic/apt-get on debian/ubuntu)

2)
Compile/install the required libraries if needed.

a) wxWidgets:
-Extract the wxWidgets tar
-Follow the instructions in docs/gtk/install.txt ('the simplest case'), but add '--with-opengl' to the ../configure line

b) FreeImage:
-Extract the FreeImage tar
-Follow the instructions in README.linux (to install normal FreeImage, not FreeImagePlus)

3)
To compile SLADE3, there are two ways to go about it, either install NetBeans IDE and use that (reccommended), or build it straight from the project Makefiles

a) IDE Compilation
-Download NetBeans IDE (6.7+) from http://netbeans.org (the C++ version)
-Run the installer (the .sh installer will need to be changed to executable, and you may have to install Java too if you haven't already)
-Run NetBeans
-Select File->Open Project and select the 'trunk' directory of the SLADE SVN
-Right click the SLADE project, select Properties, and press Apply, then OK. This will regenerate the project makefiles if needed.
-Select Unix_Release configuration from the drop-down box on the toolbar if it isn't already selected
-Click the 'Build Project' button on the toolbar

b) Makefile Compilation*
-Run 'make CONF=Unix_Release' from the trunk directory.
*This method may or may not work depending on whether the makefiles on the SVN are up-to-date or not. If compilation via this method fails, try the IDE Compilation method instead.


And that should be it. If you are having problems I can be contacted via email:
