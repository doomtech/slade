_("A useful feature of SLADE is the 'paint texture' shortcuts for 3d mode. When you change a wall or floor texture in 3d mode, hold shift when you left click on a wall/floor (by default) to select a texture, and that texture will be 'painted' along all the walls or floors of the 'room'. Play around with it to get used to how it works, it saves a lot of time!")
