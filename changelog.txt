Gtk-SLADE changelog
-------------------

Goes in bottom-up order

*: Fixed
+: Added
-: Removed
~: Changed
': Note

[23/05/06]
* Fixed crash when the texture browser had no textures visible
+ Added autocomplete popup to script editor (ctrl+space to activate)
~ DECORATE things are now added/removed as wads are opened/closed
+ Added support for '#include' in DECORATE lumps
~ Improved 2d map performance slightly :P
* Fixed an obscure crash, having a tagged item hilighted while changing maps could crash slade. I really need to rework
  my map class to eliminate any other crashes to do with attempting to access illegal array indices...
+ Added map panning (drag alt+rightclick by default)
~ Implemented an edit state system (replaces the ugly multiple bool's, like line_draw, items_moving, paste_mode etc)
~ Optimised the update_grid function, should be faster (although I don't notice any real speed improvement)

[09/05/06]
* Fixed script editor crashing when trying to save/compile scripts without a map open
+ Script editor highlighting is now implemented, colours/font styles are customisable, but not via the GUI yet (config/scripts/styles.cfg)
+ Changed script editor to use wxScintilla, now it has line numbers and proper 4-space tabs ;)

[03/05/06]
+ Scaling and transparency are now taken into account for DECORATE things (in 3d mode and 2d mode+things as sprites)
+ Added support for DECORATE things (only the new DECORATE format for now)

[03/04/06]
+ Added 'Hide IWAD Textures' option to the texture browser
* Set texture browser minimum size to 320x240, since resizing it to be really small would crash SLADE

[14/03/06]
+ Added 'Import map' feature
* 'Run map' now works when the map is unsaved (the current map is saved to sladetemp.wad and added to the list of open wads temporarily)
* Pixels of palette entry 240 are no longer transparent in sprites (health bonus sprites don't have holes now)
+ Added rotate feature (not 100% accurate, but it'll do :P)

[06/03/06]
+ Current grid size is now shown in the status bar

[04/03/06]
~ The hilight is now locked while the delete_item key is pressed
+ Added an undo point before stitching vertices after moving them (only while in vertices mode though)
+ Line lengths are now shown when moving either vertices or lines
+ Added tab to prefs dialog to setup executable paths
+ Wad files passed as parameters are now loaded on startup
* SLADE no longer crashes on startup when used for 'open with' or when a file is dragged onto it in Explorer
+ Added 'run map' command
+ Paths to the node builders are now configurable
+ Paths to glbsp and acc are now configurable

[02/03/06]
~ 3d mode things are now reset when nodes rebuilt

[01/03/06]
+ Added 'flip line' to line context menu

[24/02/06]
+ Added ability to define default door and doortrack textures (used for the 'create door' function)
+ Added a 'theme' sidebar
+ Added controls to toggle the sidebar
+ Added controls to reset x and y offsets separately in 3d mode

[23/02/06]
~ Line drawing controls now configurable (ldraw_drawpoint, ldraw_cancelpoint, ldraw_nearestvert)
~ View related keys now work while line drawing
+ Added a 'drawing options' sidebar, can be toggled in the view menu
~ Increased the accuracy of circle drawing
+ Added a 'tip of the day' feature. Not many tips yet, but I'll add to them whenever I think of one :P
+ Extended room painting functionality to flats, now it'll paint the texture to and adjacent floors/ceilings at the same height as the hilighted flat
+ Added a new control, 'change_3d_tex_paint', which browses for a texture then paints the room with it

[22/02/06]
+ Added an option the the rectangle draw function to force a square
+ Started on code for ellipse/circle drawing ;) It's in, just have to create a new 'draw options' dialog now
+ Added 'edit_createitem2' control: in vertices mode this acts like pressing shift+insert in DEU/DETH, in lines mode it is the same as edit_createitem, and in things mode it pops up the thing type selection dialog and creates a thing of the selected type
+ Added 'insert thing' option to the thing context menu (no type submenus unfortunately, since it's pretty much impossible to do with the wxwidgets menu system :/)
+ Added thing context menu (only 'properties' for now, eventually I'll add 'insert thing' with a type submenu or something)
+ Added 'properties' options to line and sector context menus
~ Item hilight is no longer drawn while moving items
~ Doubled the maximum mouse speed for the slider in the 3d mode preferences dialog
~ Selecting a different control from the input dialog now resets the 'set/accept/default/cancel' etc buttons
* Sloped floors/ceilings who's parent sectors had equal floor & ceiling heights weren't drawn
+ Added support for HIRESTEX remaps
* Re-enabled support for HIRESTEX textures

[21/02/06]
~ Disabled XP theme background gradients for tabs, since some winxp skins don't seem to like it (ie my favourite one :P)

[20/02/06] * First changelog entry for new wxWidgets version (v1.1+)
* Fixed a crash when previewing a map in a recently saved/modified wadfile (lump offsets needed reloading after node build)
~ Map is now 'cleaned' upon saving (Removes free vertices, unused sectors, unused sides and zero-length lines)
+ Added 'remove unused sidedefs' function to the Checks menu
* Replacement flats from opened pwads weren't replacing previously loaded flats
~ When a vertex is inserted it is now automatically hilighted

' Thought I'd fire up the ol' changelog again :P Here's a general list of changes since the last entry:
' ~ Moved UI to wxWidgets, which looks much better in Windows while keeping cross-platform capability
' + Map preview in the wad manager
' ~ Improvements to the args editing UI stuff
' + Option to scale text messages in 3d mode
' ~ Improved hilight lines in 3d mode
' + Context menus in line and sector edit mode (pops up the edit->line or edit->sector menus. Right click by default)
' + Middle click to snap to the nearest vertex in line draw mode
' + Mouse wheel is now configurable and usable for 3d mode controls
' + Line and sector specials are now shown on their respective edit dialogs
' ~ Thing and line flags are now defined in game configurations instead of being hardcoded
' * Page Up/Down keys now work in the texture browser
' ~ Greatly reduced loading time, textures are no longer all loaded at startup
' * Tab and Return keys now work in the input preferences dialog
' + Simple 'create sector' function (doesn't work in all situations though)
' ~ Hexen-format line and thing information is shown on the infobar (args etc)
' + 'Light gradient' function
' + Added ability to set a 'background texture' in 2d mode, useful for aligning map architecture to flat textures
' * Thing args are now saved properly when changed
' + Added back the 'Checks' menu

[15/12/05] * Last GTK-SLADE changes (v1.02)
~ Arg type dialog now creates multiple columns if there are more than 15 values (needed for the long spawn ID list)
~ Updated zdoom config with spawn IDs

+ Added a key shortcut to correct a line's sector references (ctrl+shift+s by default)

[14/12/05]
* Selecting sectors with the selection box would select single sectors multiple times (the selected items array should never have duplicates)
* Thing Z height wasn't initialised in the thine edit dialog (so editing a thing with an existing z height reset it to 0)

[12/12/05]
+ Added cvar 'reopen_wads', when true any wads that are open when SLADE is closed will be reopened next time SLADE is run

* 'Create Door' in zdoom/hexen mode now sets the repeatable flag and sets the trigger to 'player uses'

[07/12/05]

* Added checks so that flats can't be selected from the wrong side
~ Wads are now reloaded every time the wad manager is opened in case an external program has modified them

~ Greatly improved map loading speed (especially for large maps)
* Things in 3d mode could be drawn wrong when translucent walls were in view
* Fixed a few things with mixing flats/textures
~ Right clicking no longer begins an item move (it doesn't start until the mouse is moved while right click is held)
+ Added 'Correct Sector References' to the edit->line menu
+ Added 3d mode options to the preferences dialog
~ Sprites are no longer 'stretched' when allow_np2_tex is off
+ Added exit/close confirmation when there are unsaved changes
~ Changed how map changes are handled (now moving a thing doesn't require the gl nodes to be rebuilt etc etc)
+ Added search to texture browser

[19/11/05]
+ Texture browser can now be navigated with the arrow keys
+ Added texture paint function (shift+p by default, instead of the old shift+click)

[21/10/05]
+ Added a functional scripts editor (no hilighting or anything fancy yet, though)
+ SCRIPTS and BEHAVIOR lumps are no longer overwritten when saving a map that already had them

[20/10/05]
+ Added the up and down keys to the console window entry to cycle through previously entered commands
+ Added a z height entry to the thing edit dialog (totally forgot about this before :P)
* Fixed an error in the map saving that caused thing args to be saved wrong

+ Added the 'visual' tab to the preferences dialog

[18/10/05]
+ Valid map names are now read from game configurations (if defined)
+ Clicking on the sprite image in the thing edit dialog now brings up the thing browser, so it's consistent with the line edit dialog (clicking the textures opens the texture browser)
+ Texture browser now scrolls to the currently hilighted texture when appropriate
* Fixed a possible crash on undo
+ Re-added quick thing angle selection (hold and drag the middle mouse button)

+ Double-clicking a texture in the browser now selects that texture
~ Changed to GTK-2.8, now that there is finally a gladewin32 gtk2.8 package
+ Added cvar 'allow_np2_tex'. If set to false, non-power-of-two textures will be resized. Should be set to true only if the video card supports opengl 2.0.

' Got a nice new 19" LCD monitor after my old 17" CRT died ;)

[14/10/05]
+ The texture browser is up, can't do anything but view the textures for now.
~ Changed the texture system to use opengl textures instead of pixbufs, since they were proving too slow for the texture browser.

[07/10/05]
+ Started on the texture browser
+ Started on the sidedef part of the line edit dialog

[06/10/05]
* Fixed crash when creating a new thing (wasn't updating it's thing definition)
~ Replaced all the images on the info bar with my new tex_box_t structs. Makes things much easier (from a programming perspective :P)

[05/10/05]
+ Started on thing edit dialog

[02/10/05]
~ Changed default interpolation to bilinear

[30/09/05]
+ Added flat images to the sector info bar
+ Flats are now loaded
+ Added a progress bar to the console when loading textures
* Textures on the line info bar are now scaled correctly (probably a bit small for my liking though, but theres not much that can be done about that)
* Fixed texture loading stuff, now they are loaded on-demand.
+ Added basic texture loading. For now all textures are loaded as pixbufs. I can't quite figure out how to generate them on the fly (which is plenty fast enough) without it chewing up ram like nothing because the generated pixbufs aren't being deleted. It's times like these i'm beginning to regret moving away from gtkmm and it's nice memory management :P
+ Finished up the wad manager window, it's now (nearly) fully functional.
~ Changed the editor window to be the 'main' window (rather than the 'wad manager window' as its called now).

[29/09/05]
+ Implemented tag hilighting. I had the colour there, but I haven't actually had the feature implemented ever :P (It was in the very first SLADE, but I never re-implemented it after the rewrite post-0.1)
+ Added a colour configuration dialog, which mostly works except for creating/saving new schemes. Couple other problems with it too I need to sort out.
~ Reworked the colour configurations a bit (now they are in seperate files rather than one)

[28/09/05]
~ Converted a bunch of ints to doubles. Now working at very high zoom levels is much more accurate

[27/09/05]
+ Added the rest of the infobar stuff (minus stuff that needs textures/game configs)
+ Added 'blend' variable to rgba_t, now blend modes can be specified for colour config colours:
	-1 = doesn't matter, 0 = normal, 1 = additive
+ Basic line information shows up (minus the special name and side info)
+ Colour configuration can be changed via the console
+ Added back the SLADE colour configurations
+ The main linedef edit dialog works now (except 'change special' which needs game configs)
+ Implemented basic thing drawing (grey squares until I get game configs and textures loading)
+ Added a menu and toolbar to the editor window, with some nice icons I made ;)
~ Moved back to GTK 2.6 until there is a decent 2.8 win32 port (the official one has much too small fonts)
* Fixed a linux crash in setup_game_combo

[22/09/05]
+ Added console command parsing. Now it's just as functional as the original SLADE 3d mode console ;)
+ Added a function to wait for all gtk events, needed for the console and eventually for the splash screen and any progress bars.
