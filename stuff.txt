'Shit to do before first release' list (in this order):
- TEXTUREx editor
- Text editor (syntax highlighting, script compilation, find/replace)
- Media panel
- Entry search
- Archive merge
- Convert types on export
- Fix non-power-of-two textures on cards that don't support it

Feature Requests (from SLumpEd and SLADE):
- mass export to format (XWE)
- mass rename (XWE)
- lump name search
- find/replace in text editor
- improved TEXTUREx editor (DeepSea)
- Visual TEXTURES (zdoom format) editor (with the possibility to still edit as text)
- A right-click -> set lump type or equivalent to force it to read lumps correctly when it failed to identify them automatically (happens a lot to very small sprites)
TEXTUREx editor:
  - ability to 'search' for patches or textures by clicking in the list and typing the first few letters of the name, like you can in the lumps list
  - an option to automatically delete any patches from the wad that aren't used in any defined textures (maybe with option to back them up)
  - ability to double-click the name of a patch in an existing texture and type in another name, so that you can swap out one patch for another one
  - ability to move a patch forwards or backwards (i.e. to put it in front of or behind other patches)
  - list textures and patches in alphabetical order (with non-iwad ones at the bottom of the list)
  - ability to copy/paste textures (with patches), including between different TEXTUREx entries
  - find/replace for patches
- in-editor generation and editing of boom's binary animated/switches lumps. ("generation" in this case just meaning "stick the default one in there as a new lump", with the standard switches and animations from boom's default one, sort of like how a new texture1 lump gets the iwad stuff as a base)
- 'Edit as Hex' in default entry panel
- SBARINFO viewer/editor


Resources system:
- opened archives are either used as resources or not
- when searching for patches etc, resource archives are searched - IWAD archives are searched first
- archive list on archive manager panel could have 'resource' checkboxes for each list item


Lower Priority:
- LZMA/Bzip2 support
- Support for textures larger than video card can handle


ToDo List:
- Map preview
- Generic entry data view (for VERTEXES, LINEDEFS, SIDEDEFS, SECTORS, THINGS, PLAYPAL, DEMO* ...)
- ZDoom fonts handling
- Cleanup menu (unused patches, textures, flats, unneeded entries...)
- Tall sprites/doomgfx support
- Option not to show save dialog on export (or show only once)
- ACS/script compiler
- Recent files list
- If a wad is opened from within a zip open it in another tab
- Auto save changes


Programming-wise:
- Should probably change all memory pointers that are meant to be read-only to const pointers



Improvements/Features:
- Better entry type system (ideally user-configurable, and with some kind of subtypes/groups system for entries of different formats but handled in the same way, like gfx etc)
- Tree view option for entry list


Improved Type System:
- Types differentiated by DATA format rather than arbitrary 'type' (ie Doom Gfx, PNG, JPG, text, etc etc)
- Define more detailed information via entry exProps perhaps
- User-defined, separate 'data format' from 'type'
  - Define data formats by:
    - Minimum/maximum size
    - Byte pattern to look for at a certain offset in the file (ideally allow multiple of these)
      something like:
      pattern = 10, 255, 255, 255, 0; = look for 255,255,255,0 at offset 10 in file
    - Some inbuilt tests for more complex things (wad files, doom gfx etc)
  - Define types by:
    - Data format (can be 'any' but not a good idea)
      format = text; (data is text format)
    - Filename to look for
      filename = "animdefs", 0; (filename is "animdefs", not case-sensitive)
    - Extension to look for
      extension = "acs";


Ideas:
- Ability to perform all archive/entry management functions via the console (possibly allow scripts too?)
- 'Animation viewer' (select a bunch of sprites to test an animation or whatever)


Completed Features/Requests
- In the image viewer, a drop-down list for display method: automatic (let the program determine), world sprite (with the crossed axes), hud sprite (in the box), graphics (without axes nor box). The automatic selection, based on offset values, isn't always accurate.
- Still in the image viewer, another drop-down list which lets you select which palette to use, from a list of named palettes that you can create elsewhere. (I imagine a res/palette folder in which we could just export PLAYPAL lumps, giving them names like "Doom.pal", "Heretic.pal", "Simplicity.pal" etc.) With of course a default to use the PLAYPAL from the current file, if any, or that of the selected main iwad. But we'd get to change it if so we want.
- Palette conversion
- When converting a picture to PNG, having the choice between indexed colors + alpha or full colors + alpha.- Finish gfx panel (zoom, offset editing)
- Copy/Cut/Paste entries
